# Project Base with Vaadin and Spring Boot


## Running the Application

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project.

After importing the maven project, you need to change the "spring.datasource.url" in your application.properties.

You find the databasefile in the path myhimoapp/src/main/resources/data/demo, but you need add you personal project path. There is some sample data inside, the databasefiles are part of .gitignore, so please just check in, if the schema changes.

Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the `Application` class directly from your IDE.

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

If you want to run the application locally in the production mode, run `mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`.

For uploading the jar to aws, build with

"mvn clean package -Pproduction -DskipTests"

To run Integration Tests, execute `mvn verify -Pintegration-tests`.
