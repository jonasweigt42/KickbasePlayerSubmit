# Project Base with Vaadin and Spring Boot

The best way to create your own project based on this starter is [start.vaadin.com](https://start.vaadin.com/) - you can get only the necessary parts and choose the package naming you want to use.

## Running the Application

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project.

Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the `Application` class directly from your IDE.

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

If you want to run the application locally in the production mode, run `mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`.

To run Integration Tests, execute `mvn verify -Pintegration-tests`.

The database is a local H2 database. Open the H2 console while the server is running on 
localhost:8080/h2-console

If your put a "data.sql" in src/main/resources, it will be executed every time you start the server
